## Managing Members

If you're the **owner** of a project, you can manage who has access to it by visiting the **Members** page. From there, you can:

* **Add or remove** collaborators
* **Change roles** (member, viewer, or owner)
* **View current project participants**

### Roles You Can Assign

| Role       | Permissions                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full control: manage members, edit project settings, move the project, and delete/archive it.  |
| **Member** | Can view and interact with stories, add tasks and comments, and move stories through workflow. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to the project. Cannot make changes or add content.                           |

> 🔒 Only **owners** can manage project membership or change roles.
