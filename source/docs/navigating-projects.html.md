## Navigating Projects & Workspaces

Iterator provides several ways to access your projects and workspaces easily.

### From the Dashboard

When you sign in to Iterator, you’ll land on your **Dashboard** by default. If you’d prefer to start from the last project you visited, you can change this setting in your **Profile preferences** under the **Start Page** option.

By default, the Dashboard displays all your projects. To view and manage all your **Workspaces**, click the **Workspaces** tab at the top of the page.

### From the Projects Menu

You can also switch between projects or workspaces using the **Projects menu**, located at the top-left corner of most pages in Iterator.

The menu will either display the name of the currently open project or say "Iterator" when you're not inside a project, such as when you're on the Dashboard.

**Tip:** Click the **Iterator logo** at the far left of the top navigation bar to return to your Dashboard at any time.

The Projects menu shows a list of up to 24 of your most recently accessed projects, ordered alphabetically. Just click on the name of a project or workspace to open it.

You can also:

* Create a new project
* Create a new workspace
* Access your Dashboard

To browse a full list of your projects or workspaces, use the **Show All Projects** or **Show All Workspaces** links from the menu.
