If you're the **owner of a project**, you can move it to a different **organization** by visiting the **Project Settings** page.

> ⚠️ You must be an **owner**, **administrator**, or **project creator** in the destination organization. The new organization must also have room in its current plan to accommodate any additional projects or collaborators.

2. In **Project Settings**, next to the **Organization** field, click **Change Organization**.
3. Select the new organization from the list.
4. Click **Save** to complete the move.

## Consolidating Projects from Multiple Organizations

If you're managing multiple organizations, you may want to **consolidate all your projects under a single organization** for easier management. Follow these steps:

### 1. Identify or Create a Central Organization

* Choose one organization to keep.
* Make sure its **plan limits** can accommodate all the projects and collaborators being moved in.

### 2. Set Roles in the Central Organization

To move a project into a different organization, the person performing the move must be one of the following **in the target organization**:

* **Organization owner**
* **Admin**
* **Project Creator**

Admins and owners can update roles on the **Organization Members** page.

### 3. Move Projects

> Note: All members of a project move with it. Nothing else about the project changes—just the organization it's housed in.

Steps to move:

1. Click your avatar at the top right of the interface and select **Organizations**.
2. Click **Manage Organization** next to the organization containing the project you want to move.
3. Go to the **Projects** tab.
4. Hover over a project and click **Settings**.
5. Next to the **Organization** field, click **Change Organization**.
6. Select the target organization and click **Save**.
7. Repeat for each project you want to move.

> 🛑 If the central organization isn’t listed as an option, you may not have sufficient permissions. Ask the organization’s owner or an admin to make you an admin or project creator.

### Alternative Method

Another option: Ask each project owner to add you as a **co-owner** on their project. Once added, you can move the project yourself.

## Final Clean-Up

After all projects are moved:

* Ask the owners of now-empty organizations to **cancel** or **delete** them.
* Consider deleting any duplicate-named organizations to avoid confusion.
* **Save receipts** or important records before deleting.

Going forward, encourage team members to create all new projects under the **central organization**. If someone creates a project elsewhere by mistake, you can use the same steps above to move it.
