## Showing All Projects

The **All Projects** page in Iterator lists every project youâ€™ve created or been invited to. You can access it from the **Dashboard** or the **Projects menu**, as explained in [Navigating Projects & Workspaces](/docs/navigating-projects).

### On the Projects Page

Click any project or workspace listed to open it. You can also check the **Show archived projects** box to include archived items in the list.

For each project, you'll see:

* Total members
* Total stories
* The account the project belongs to

You can also click the **Settings** link next to a project or workspace to manage its configuration.

!\[All Projects view]

> **Note:** Only the **project owner** can edit settings. Other members and viewers will have read-only access.

If you are an account owner or administrator, you can click the **account name** to access its **Plans & Billing** page. If not, the link will be disabled.

### Sorting Projects

By default, projects are listed by **most recently accessed**. You can also sort them by:

* Alphabetical order
* Account
* Date created

Use the **Sort** menu located at the top right of the projects list to change the order.
